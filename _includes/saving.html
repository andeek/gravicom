<h3>Saving</h3>
<p>The work performed by a user in visualizing graphs and community structure can be downloaded as a data set from gravicom with current communities stored. This feature can be used as a save point in processing a graph or as a means to export changes made in gravicom to another tool.</p>

<p>To save a graph, click <img src="images/save.png" alt="save dataset"/> and a GML file with the current status of the graph groupings will be saved to your computer's downloads folder. This file can later be reloaded into <em>gravicom</em> using the process detailed in the previous section of this tutorial.</p>
