<h3>Motifs</h3>

<p>It can be difficult to glean meaning from a visual representation in large/complex graphs. For this reason, it is usseful to replace repeated patterns in a graph by a representation, to simplify a network. These repeated patterns are called motifs. One such motif is a clique, or a 'perfect' community. in <em>gravicom</em> we use this idea to replace communities with a 'super node' representation. This practice results in fewer nodes and edges to display. thus reducing visual complexity of the graph visualization and allowing the user to analyze the network structure more accurately.</p>
