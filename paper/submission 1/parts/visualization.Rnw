Network analysis involves understanding complex relationships between entities. Frequently this is done graphically using a node-link diagram in which nodes are represented as a single point and a connecting edge is represented as a line connecting two points. In complex or large graphs it can be difficult to glean any meaning from such a visualization. Dunne and Schneiderman introduce the idea of motifs, or repeated patterns in a graph. One example of a motif is a clique, in which all nodes are connected to all other nodes within the clique. [This concept is similar to the concept of a community.] These motifs can dominate much of the display in a network visualization. By replacing the motifs with representations and removing the corresponding extra edges, the visualization will be more effective at revealing relationships. With fewer nodes and edges to display, visual complexity of the graph visualization is greatly reduced, allowing the user to analyze the network structure more accurately.
