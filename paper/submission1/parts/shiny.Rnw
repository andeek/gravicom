Shiny \cite{rs-shiny} is an {\tt R} package created by RStudio that enables {\tt R} users to create an interactive web application that utilizes {\tt R} as the background engine. Through default methods to build user interface elements in HTML and a handle to the server side code, Shiny is a simple way to turn {\tt R} code into a website. 

gravicom uses the Shiny functionality to create user controls, pass correctly formatted data to the client, and as a means to display summary information regarding the user's interactions with a graph at any point in time. In this context, Shiny serves as the translator between the formatted data and what the user sees and interacts with on his screen.
